        Washington is full of people who talk about problems. We need people who
        fix them. Here is exactly where Michael stands on the issues that affect
        your wallet and your safety.

            Georgians are paying too much for gas, groceries, and housing. It’s
            not just "inflation"—it’s corporate opportunism. Michael supports a
            federal ban on price gouging for essential goods during economic
            crises.
          </p>
          <p>Furthermore, we need to bring supply chains home.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Make it in America:</strong> Tax incentives for companies
              that manufacture in Georgia, not overseas.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Energy Independence:</strong> An "all-of-the-above" energy
              strategy that lowers gas prices while investing in Georgia’s
              growing battery belt.

            When a rural hospital closes, a town dies. In District 1, we have
            counties with zero OBGYNs. That is unacceptable. Michael proposes a
            "Rural Health Lifeline" bill that changes Medicare reimbursement
            rates for hospitals serving populations under 50,000.
          </p>
          <p>
            He also supports capping insulin at $35 for everyone, not just
            seniors, and allowing Medicare to negotiate all prescription drug
            prices immediately.

            You can’t serve the people if you’re serving your portfolio. Members
            of Congress routinely outperform the stock market because they have
            information you don’t.
          </p>
          <p>
            Michael will co-sponsor legislation on Day 1 to ban individual stock
            trading for members of Congress and their immediate families. If you
            want to trade stocks, go to Wall Street. If you want to serve, go to
            Washington. You shouldn't do both.

            With bases like Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield, our district
            is home to heroes. But the VA backlog is a national disgrace.
            Michael wants to streamline the transition from active duty to
            civilian life.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Automatic Enrollment:</strong> VA benefits should auto-enroll
              upon discharge. No paperwork, no fighting for what you earned.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mental Health:</strong> Expand mental health vouchers allowing
              veterans to see private providers if the VA wait time exceeds 14 days.
