          <h2 class="section-title">Built from the Bottom,<br>Fighting for the Middle</h2>

          <p>Michael McCord knows what it’s like to work for everything you get. Growing up poor in rural South
            Carolina, he was raised by his grandmother, who worked in administration during the Clinton years. She
            taught him that hard work and working-class values go hand in hand. That combination of grit and principles
            has defined everything he’s done since.</p>

          <p>While other kids his age were figuring out college plans, McCord was already working double shifts in
            manufacturing to pay his way through school. He spent 12-hour days on the BMW assembly line, and those long
            days taught him something you can’t learn in a class: What it really means to live paycheck to paycheck and
            work for a living. It’s a lesson that still drives him today.</p>

          <p>McCord has been fighting in Democratic politics since 2008, cutting his teeth working races from coast to
            coast. By 2020, he was the Southern strategy lead for Tim Ryan’s presidential bid—the kind of job you only
            get when party leaders know you can turn tough districts blue.</p>

          <p>His consulting work isn’t about big corporate deals; it’s about helping the local restaurant owner navigate
            supply chain costs or showing a family how to cut through insurance red tape. Last year, that hands-on
            approach saved his clients over $3.5 million dollars.</p>

          <p class="emphasized-text">McCord represents something coastal Georgia hasn’t seen in a while: a Blue Dog
            Democrat who has lived the working-class struggles.</p>

          <p>Georgia’s 1st Congressional District is one of the most diverse in the state from bustling ports and
            military bases to small towns and farmland.</p>
          <p>For too long, Georgia families here have been left behind. Michael McCord is running to ensure every
            community, whether rural or coastal, has the same opportunity to thrive.</p>
          <p>With incumbent Congressman Buddy Carter off of the ballot this year, this race is an open seat and the best
            opportunity that Georgia has to elect a true representative for working people.</p>

        <p class="subtitle center">Michael’s vision is built on three guiding principles</p>

        <div class="principles-grid">
          <div data-number="01">
            <h3>Putting working people first</h3>
            <p>Small businesses, farmers, and local workers are the backbone of our economy. Michael will fight for
              policies that cut red tape, expand access to capital for local entrepreneurs, protect pensions, and raise
              wages so families can build a better future. He will prioritize investments in infrastructure, like rural
              broadband, safe roads, and modern ports.</p>
          </div>
          <div data-number="02">
            <h3>Fighting to keep healthcare local</h3>
            <p>Too many rural hospitals and clinics are closing, forcing families to drive hours just to see a doctor.
              Michael will push for federal funding to stabilize rural hospitals, expand telehealth, and ensure mental
              health services are accessible in small towns. No mother should have to travel across counties to deliver
              a baby.</p>
          </div>
          <div data-number="03">
            <h3>Training the next generation</h3>
            <p>The future of Georgia’s economy depends on a strong workforce. Michael will champion apprenticeship
              programs, vocational training, and partnerships with community colleges. His goal is simple: young people
              should be able to build a life right here at home, without having to leave their community behind.</p>

              <p><strong>Our coast is vital to Georgia’s economy.</strong> Yet flooding, stronger storms, and outdated
                infrastructure keep putting homes and businesses at risk.</p>
              <p>I’ll push for federal investment in:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Upgraded drainage and storm-water systems</li>
                <li>Stronger levees and flood barriers</li>

              <p><strong>Border security is national security.</strong> I support completing physical barriers where
                they’re effective, deploying modern technology at crossings, and giving Border Patrol the resources they
                need to do their job.</p>
              <p>We also need to fix our broken immigration system with faster processing of legal claims and work
                authorization for industries that need labor. This stops illegal hiring that undercuts wages for Georgia
                workers.</p>

              <p><strong>Rural hospitals across Georgia are closing.</strong> We’ve lost maternity care in dozens of
                counties. Georgians pay federal taxes that go to healthcare in other states while our hospitals shut
                down.</p>
              <p>I’ll fight to bring those dollars back to Georgia to keep our hospitals and emergency rooms open.
                Healthcare decisions should be made in Georgia, not Washington.</p>
              <p>We can bring down prices by letting Medicare negotiate more drug costs and expanding those same caps to
                everyone, not just seniors.</p>
